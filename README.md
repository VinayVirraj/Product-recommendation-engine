## About the engine

Performed exploratory data analysis on the data and extracted
relevant info from the data.

Data was split into train and test and different types of
recommender systems were used to get varied results from the data.Proper hyper parameter
tuning was performed to increase our models recommending ability.

Finally built a product recommendation engine which
recommends n products to the customers and also performs well given the amount and
complexity of the dataset.
